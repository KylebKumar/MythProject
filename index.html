    <h1>Origins</h1>
    <p>The Chupacabra was first spotted in Puerto Rico in 1995 where they were blamed for the strange deaths of goats and other livestock. Since then, sightings have been reported as far north as the state of Maine and as far south as the country of Chile.</p>
    <p>A few sightings in the same areas have been confirmed to be dog/coyote hybrids that lost their fur due to a mite infestation and attacked livestock due to the infestation leaving them unable to catch prey in the wild.</p>
    <p>However, the initial sightings were decidedly uncanine-like, as they stood on two hind legs and were described as having spikes on their backs. Two prevailing theories on these creatures are that they were escaped rhesus monkeys that were being used in blood experiments or that these sightings were inspired by an alien movie that was released right before the first sighting in Puerto Rico.</p>
    <br/>
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>More recently, the monster has been described as a mix between a kangaroo and a bald dog, and most witnesses claim it has red eyes and reptilian skin. The creature weighs approximately 150 pounds and differing accounts put the monster between 3ft 3in and 6ft 6in. Some witnesses even claim that the beast has large wings and alien-like blue skin. The image below is a depiction of what the Chupacabra is most commonly described as.</p>

    <p>And the following image is something closer to what initial reports claimed to see.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>Chupacabra attacks are characterized by uneaten corpses devoid of blood. This is why they have been given a reputation of being bloodsuckers. Their name in Spanish translates to blood-sucking goat: <i>chupar</i> (to suck) + <i>cabra</i> (goat).</p>
    <br/>
    <h1>Connections to Other Monsters</h1>
    <p>The Chupacabra is a modern take on the vampire. It requires the life force of other animals (their blood) to survive and actively hunts its targets. It is notably different from the common depictions of human-like monsters as it is not believed to be immortal nor is it as intelligent as a character like Dracula. </p>
    <p>Some have compared it to the Sasquatch as both creatures are based on animals found in their region of discovery and neither have been confirmed to exist.</p>
